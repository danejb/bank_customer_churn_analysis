## How to Interpret

### Step 1: Start Here
Look at the **Overall Churn Rate** card: 20.38%
- This is the baseline problem
- 1 in 5 customers are gone

### Step 2: Find the Pattern
Look at the **Churn by Tenure** line chart:
- Where is churn highest? (Year 0-1: 23%)
- Where is the lowest? (Year 4-7: 17%)
- This shows WHERE to focus effort

### Step 3: Understand Demographics
Look at the **Churn by Age** bar chart:
- Which ages churn most?
- Which ages have best retention?
- This shows WHO to target

### Step 4: See the Picture
Look at the **Customer Segments** pie chart:
- 79% still active (good base)
- 21% churned (signigicant loss)
- Confirms the overall problem
